Project abstract:
This Ph.D. research from Silvia de Melo Futada (sfutada@ufl.edu) addresses environmental governance and justice
regarding indigenous knowledge and management in the Brazilian Amazonia, specifically the Waimiri Atroari
Indigenous Territory. The Waimiri-Atroari (WA) - a Carib-speaking indigenous society — were betrayed, hunted,
and nearly exterminated: decreasing from an estimated population of 3,000 in the 1900s to 374 people in the 1980s.
Territorial reductions and national infrastructure projects were constructed therein, flooding entire villages.
Nowadays, after 35 years, the WA society went from an almost extinct society, persecuted in their territory, to a
flourishing population in some of the best- conserved Indigenous Lands (IL) in Brazil. The community established a
territorial protection program that includes monitoring wildlife-vehicle collisions and a health and educational
system in their language, with over 2,400 individuals. This research provides a baseline understanding of this
unique case of IL governance based on community management and indigenous strategies, providing a model of
governance policies in an intercultural context. It also aims to develop a codesign of the research process with the
WA society. I will address the research questions through interdisciplinary mixed-method research.

Types of data produced
The types of data, samples, physical collections, software, curriculum materials, and other materials to be
produced in the course of the project.

Data types and descriptions (9)
1. Occupancy models of animal species: occupancy models of local species involved in wildlife-vehicle collision
and its quantitative biophysical dataset (metrics are yet to be defined). The wildlife-vehicle collision dataset
includes observations from 1997 to 2022 in the 125 km from BR 174 highway that crosses Waimiri Atroari
Indigenous Territory (TIWA), Amazonas/Roraima, Brazil, and belongs to Waimiri Atroari Community
Association (ACWA). Its utilization will follow the data sovereignty protocol developed throughout the research
process.
2. Historical legal violations: a quantitative and qualitative dataset about historical violations derived from the
archival research, including final judicial actions against illegal practices in TIWA or against WA society,
collected in federal, state, and municipal institutions from the national justice system and other institutions.
3. TIWA and other Brazilian ILs comparison: qualitative dataset comparing the professional team, retention,
activities, budget governance and other institutional analysis metrics from TIWA and other Brazilian ILs. The
data will derived from the documental research of the Indigenous Peoples National Fundation and Ministry of
Planning, Budget and Management
4. Participatory mapping about TIWA governance: maps produced through participatory mapping exercises during
local meetings with WA and Waimiri Atroari Support Program (PWA) members will generate quantitative and
qualitative data about TIWA governance (Amazonas/Roraima, Brazil).
5. TIWA governance: qualitative data from semi-structured interviews (Bernard, 2011) with 100 to 150 Waimiri
Atroari members and 30 to 80 members from Waimiri Atroari Support Program. The interviews will be
conducted in the TIWA (Amazonas/Roraima, Brazil) and Manaus (Amazonas, Brazil) from 2023 to 2025. The
informed consent will follow the IRB202300168. I will take notes in a notebook and record interviews with H1n
zoom, transcribing with the anonymization of the interviewers. I will use the software MAXQDA® to the
qualitative data analysis.
6. Indigenous Lands policies and TIWA history qualitative data from semi-structured interviews (Bernard, 2011)
with an estimated 30 - 100 people involved in indigenous territory governance and indigenous policy: researchers
(such as National University of Brasilia, University of Campinas, University of Sao Paulo, Amazonas Federal
University, Amazonas National Research Institute, and others); policymakers (such as Indigenous Peoples
National Fundation, Ministry of Indigenous Peoples, Public Ministry); the technical team from different
institutions, including civil society organizations (Instituto Socioambiental, Conselho Indigenista Missionário,
and others). The interviews will be conducted in Manaus (AM), Boa Vista (RR), Brasília (DF), São Paulo (SP),
and, if necessary, remotely, from 2023 to 2025. The informed consent will follow the IRB202300168. I will take
notes in a notebook and record interviews with H1n zoom, transcribing with the anonymization of the
interviewers. I will use the software MAXQDA® to the qualitative data analysis.
7. Ethnobotanical assessment of ethno-artifacts (Alexiades & Sheldon, 1995): from interviews with the Waimiri
Atroari members, I will collect quantitative data about the identification, knowledge and uses of the plants used to
build the collective long house and the cassava flour house in the WA village, and the plants used for making
tradicional utensils such as bracelets, arrows and traditional backpack to carry manioc. Genus and age from each
member will be documented. The interviews will be conducted in the TIWA (Amazonas/Roraima, Brazil) and
Manaus (Amazonas, Brazil) from 2023 to 2025. I will take notes in a paper-sheet and record interviews with H1n
zoom, transcribing with the anonymization of the interviewers. The informed consent will follow the
IRB202300168.
8. Ethnobotanical photographs collection: a collection of digital photographs will document the ethno-artifacts and
the ethnobotanical assessmen in the TIWA (Amazonas/Roraima, Brazil) from 2023 to 2025.
9. Territorial governance audiovisual collection: a collection of photographs and videos from the Waimiri Atroari
Indigenous territory's daily activities related to territorial governance collected in the TIWA (Amazonas/Roraima,
Brazil) from 2023 to 2025.

Data will be collected and produced from 2023 to 2026.

Data and metadata standards
The standards to be used for data and metadata format and content (where existing standards are absent or
deemed inadequate, this should be documented along with any proposed solutions or remedies).

All data will be in a tidy format standard using the naming convection description_date. Digital audio files will be
saved using the naming convention alpha-numeric pseudonym code_approximate original recording time_date. All
dates in ISO format (YYYYMMDD). Content will be saved in nonproprietary file formats (.csv, .txt, .ods, .jpeg, .png,
.mp3, .mp4, and, if necessary, .pdf) to ensure flexibility and avoid loss due to software obsolescence (Borer et al .
2009). A .txt file will accompany the data providing metadata, and whenever available for each dataset, the metadata
will follow Michener et al. (1997).

will be credited acknowledging the funders and University of Florida, with an assigned DOI.

Plans for archiving and preservation
Plans for archiving data, samples, and other research products, and for preservation of access to them.

The data collected through digital field notes, including photographs of notebooks, will be anonymized and encrypted
digitally. All data and metadata developed during this study will be stored in password-protected and encrypted
research spaces. Digital audio files will be processed and saved as password-protected files. Anonymized interview
transcripts will be saved as password-protected. Once imported into the qualitative analysis software, they will be
saved as password-protected files in its unique format. Metadata and anonymization keys will be saved as password-
protected .txt files.

Besides being storage in my encrypted computer and in my personal folder in the UF google drive and dropbox, all
protected files will be backed up in two independent encrypted portable external hard drives storage in two different
secure location at the University of Florida, with the physical notebooks. 

Once per week, I will proceed with the cloud and one external hard drives backups, and daily with the computer and
the second external hard drives. The digital data for the project will not exceed 3 T.

The deposition of data sets and the acquisition of the external hd are estimated in $1,000USD.
